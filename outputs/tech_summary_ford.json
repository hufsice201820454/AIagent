      "summary": "Ford's E-Transit underwent rigorous testing in its Environmental Test Chamber, simulating extreme temperatures from the Sahara to Siberia to optimize its all-electric powertrain and cabin efficiency. The vehicle features a 68-kWh lithium-ion battery pack with liquid-cooling technology for enhanced performance in harsh conditions, and it is housed beneath the load floor with side-impact protection. Additionally, the E-Transit includes a Scheduled Pre-Conditioning feature that allows drivers to preheat or cool the cabin while the vehicle is charging, preserving battery charge for driving."

This infrastructure will significantly reduce charging times for electric vehicles; for instance, the Mustang Mach-E can gain up to 57 miles of range in just 10 minutes at an IONITY station and can charge from 10% to 80% in approximately 38 minutes on a DC fast charger. Additionally, the Ford Connected Wallbox can provide up to five times the charging power of a standard domestic socket for home use."
