      "summary": "Ford's E-Transit underwent rigorous testing in its Environmental Test Chamber, simulating extreme temperatures from the Sahara to Siberia to optimize its all-electric powertrain and cabin efficiency. The vehicle features a 68-kWh lithium-ion battery pack with liquid-cooling technology for enhanced performance in harsh conditions, and it is housed beneath the load floor with side-impact protection. Additionally, the E-Transit includes a Scheduled Pre-Conditioning feature that allows drivers to preheat or cool the cabin while the vehicle is charging, preserving battery charge for driving."

      "summary": "Ford plans to install 1,000 charging points at its facilities over the next three years and is a founding member of the IONITY consortium, which aims to establish 400 fast-charging stations in Europe by year-end, featuring a capacity of 350 kW. This infrastructure will significantly reduce charging times for electric vehicles; for instance, the Mustang Mach-E can gain up to 57 miles of range in just 10 minutes at an IONITY station and can charge from 10% to 80% in approximately 38 minutes on a DC fast charger. Additionally, the Ford Connected Wallbox can provide up to five times the charging power of a standard domestic socket for home use."
