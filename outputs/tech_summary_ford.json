      "summary": "Ford plans to install 1,000 charging points at its facilities over the next three years and is a founding member of the IONITY consortium, which aims to establish 400 fast-charging stations in Europe with a capacity of 350 kW by year-end. This infrastructure will significantly reduce charging times for electric vehicles, with the Mustang Mach-E capable of gaining up to 57 miles of range in just 10 minutes at an IONITY station and charging from 10% to 80% in approximately 38 minutes on a DC fast charger. Additionally, the Ford Connected Wallbox will provide up to five times the charging power of a standard domestic socket for home use."

      "summary": "The all-new Ford Mondeo features an Active Thermal Management System that optimizes warm-up times by selectively cooling components, alongside a variable oil pump that minimizes parasitic losses through on-demand oil pressure adjustments. Both the 150PS and 180PS 2.0 TDCi engines can be paired with either a six-speed manual or a six-speed PowerShift automatic transmission, achieving ECOnetic specifications of 107g/km CO2 emissions and 68.9mpg fuel efficiency."

      "summary": "Ford engineers, as part of the CEVOLVER project, conducted research on heat management in electric vehicles (EVs) to enhance vehicle design and software updates. The findings emphasized the importance of maintaining internal temperature, particularly in delivery vans where frequent door openings lead to rapid heat loss. The project highlighted the potential of using a heat exchanger to recover waste heat from the electric drive, thereby improving energy efficiency, extending range, and reducing operational costs."
